# tup0 - a simple text editor (inspired by Ed and Vim).

This is meant to be a super simple text editor with a limited command subset. In the future, if I enjoy using it, I'll add more commands as I go. Feel free to use it and hopefully enjoy it.

> [!WARNING]
> This software is unfinished. Keep your expectations low.

## REQUIREMENTS:

    [x] be as SIMPLE as possible.
    [x] commands similar to VIM.
    [x] ":h"                     - help.
    [x] ":q"                     - quit.
    TODO:                        ...
