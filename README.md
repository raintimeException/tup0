# tup0 - a simple text editor (inspired by Ed and Vim).

    This is meant to be a super simple text editor with a limited command subset.
    In the future, if I enjoy using it, I'll add more commands as I go.
    Feel free to use it and hopefully enjoy it.

## REQUIREMENTS:

    [] be as SIMPLE as possible.
    [] commands similar to VIM.
    [] use buffer (arraylist).
    [] ":h"                     - help.
    [] ":i" or ":a"             - insert.
    [] ":a"                     - append.
    [] ":w [filename]"          - write.
    [] ":d[linenumber]"         - delete line.
    [] ":ex"                    - explore current directory (?)
    [] ":q"                     - quit.
    TODO:                       ...
